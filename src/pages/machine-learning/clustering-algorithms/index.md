## Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is the process of dividing data into separated groups (clusters), while ensuring that:
- Each cluster contains similar objects
- Objects which do not belong to the same clusters are not similar

The difficulty lies in the definition of a similarity measure that can separate the data in the way we want. For instance, a group of persons can be separated by gender, hair color, weight, race...etc.

Since the data points belong usually to a high-dimensional space, the similarity measure is often defined as a distance between two vectors (Euclidean, Manhathan, Cosine, Mahalanobis...)

The goal of clustering is to automatically reorganize unlabeled data without prior knowledge about the meaning of these data. That's why clustering algorithms are often used in Unsupervised Learning and Data Mining.

#### Famous clustering algorithms
- K-means
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM)
- Affinity Propagtion (AP)
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- AGNES (agglomerative nesting)
- DIANA (divisive analysis)
